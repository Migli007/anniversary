            Hi Claire,<br /><br />
            Where do I begin? A lot of things has happened between us. We experienced a lot of memories, a lot of sweet moments, some bad ones, and a billion more emotions. Now, the question is..how? After everything, why and how am I still in love with you? Why do I still want this to work? Why do I still choose you? 
            <br /> <br />
            Well, the answer is pretty simple. I just do. I could say a billion reasons on why I still love you. But, when all those reasons are gone, when u are at ur worst, I would undoubtly, willingly, strongly, firmly, unbelievably, genuinely, forever, still love with everything I have and with everything I can. I just do. I really do. 
            <br /><br />
            When Im with you, when I just look at you with no words spoken, know that Im just memorizing every part you. Im memorizing every mole, every eyelash, every mark, every hairstrand. Im non stop printing every beauty of your smile. Im memorizing every tone of your voice. Im understanding every behavior of yours, no matter how silly or how normal it may be. I have your laughter on repeat on my head. Your words of reassurance are kept in a special library in my brain. Everything you do, no matter how small or big, means the whole universe to me. You dont need to try hard to do anything special because to me, you pretty much a living angel I pretty much want to kidnap in my eyes. 
            <br /><br />
            Sure, you may try to fight me and say you're not who I say you are. Sure you have faults, you have made mistakes,sure you have hurt me a couple of times, you may think that you are not giving me everything. But Claire, just a hold of your hand, just a feeling of your touch, your embrace, just looking at my reflection on to your eyes, your words of love, words of reassurance, a feeling of your presence, letting me know that Im still the only man you love, telling me that you still wish to spend the rest of your life with me, means everything to me and will always have me running back to you. Makes me believe that we still have a chance to finish what we started.
            <br /><br />
            I know I have made a lot of mistakes. I know I have hurt you. And I am truly sorry for all of it. I have never meant to hurt nor will I ever will. I am no perfect person and I know that I cant always be perfect fo you. But being perfect is not I will strive for. What I will strive for, is to be the man who will always answer your call, the man who will always see you as the most amazing and beautiful woman you are and will always be, the man who would always give you reassurance that I still see you as the love of my life, the man who will work his hardest to make you happy, the man who will always support you in everything, the man who would never give you up regardless of everything. I want to be the man who will always cherish you, the man you wish to spend all my life with. The man will always and forever, love you. 
            <br /><br />
            I know we are still young. I know we still have a lot things to figure out. But Claire, ever since the the rockwell lights reflected on to you, the moment into your eyes and you look into mine, the moment your body against mine, I just knew, I cant lose you. I cant ever lose what we have. And so I will do everything I can, to hold on to you. No matter difficult it maybe, I will keep holding on to you and to this love. Happy anniversary, hon! I love you.
